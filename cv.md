I want to program, create games or useful applications. I'm purposeful, diligent, communicative. I work at the music school No. 6, I have prepared several laureates of international and republican competitions.  I really liked programming, I first signed up for automation courses and passed them, but I want to write code in frontend.

I studied Java core, Jenkins, Allure, JBDC, Maven.
